# Typhoon

The Typhoon difficulty is a challenge a step above Monsoon, for those who dare - on top of Monsoon's modifiers, players are subject to 175% difficulty scaling, the amount of enemies that can appear at a time is doubled*, monsters are spawned 25% faster, and experience / gold rewards are decreased by 20%. 

Of course, added challenge is not without extra rewards to be gained! A handful of survivors are rewarded with a "Grand Mastery" skin for successfully clearing a run on the Typhoon difficulty:

 - Commando
 - Nemesis Commando
 - Huntress
 - MUL-T
 - Acrid
 - Captain
 - Executioner
