One of the most notable run-changing features introduced by Starstorm 2 is the event system. As you progress through runs, you'll be challenged by the planet itself as supernatural powers and forces of nature work together to see your swift demise.

All events happen randomly according to their own director, based on run progression. Specific of details of each can be found below:

## Storms

**A storm is approaching..**
Storms are randomly occurring events that begin happening after Stage 3. As the skies darken and rain begins to fall, the planet's monsters unrelenting aggression is pushed even further.  This is presented in the following buffs:

 - +50% movement speed
 - +50% attack speed
 - +20% base damage
 - -20% skill cooldowns
 - +20 armor

Surviving a storm is no easy feat, though each monster dropped during the event will drop doubled gold and 150% experience.

## Nemesis Invasion

**You feel an ominous presence...**
After Stage 5, survivors familiar yet unfamiliar will occasionally appear in your runs, seeming to only have one objective: your defeat! What compels these mysterious survivors? What do they fight for?

Upon defeating a nemesis survivor, they will drop a unique Sibylline-tier item, and will also unlock them as a selectable survivor for future runs. There is no way to force or predict this event, though there are plans for this in the near future. Details on each Sibylline item can be found on the Items page.

## Empyrean Invasion
<details open><summary>Open Details</summary>

The apex of Petrichor V's enchanted monsters - not attuned to one specific element, but to existence itself, as it carries the effects of every other elite monster the planet will throw your way, those being:

 - Overloading
 - Glacial
 - Blazing
 - Mending (Requires *Survivors of the Void* expansion)
 - Malachite
 - Celestine

 The Empyrean Invasion event spawns a single Empyrean elite enemy on the stage as a boss - while defeating it is not necessary to escape through the teleporter, it is recommended, as Empyrean monsters will drop multiple items, including a heightened chance at an elite aspect!
